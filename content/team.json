    "bio": "I’m a 15-year-old web designer and developer from Germany. I founded Webwing in early 2025 to help aviation firms turn their average web presences into the absolute best of the best. Besides designing and coding, I have a great passion for aviation, cycling, engineering and working out. My favorite movie? Top Gun! I taught myself to code in the summer break of 2023 and have been building out my design and development skills ever since. I’m your guy for web design and everything related to your online presence.",
